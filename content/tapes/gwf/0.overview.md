To be entirely honest with you, I hardly even know what most of these tracks are about. The record is about 30min long but damn does it sound good.

A lot of these tracks are about love, or at least I think so. Love that's out of reach or love you just can't keep. Twin fantasy is a record designed around the love for an ideal of someone you've made in your head  
Howver here there's a lot more love for a person, they seem more real somehow. Both *'Tin man'* and *'Freak'* deal with another person in a way similar records dont.

I think this is about as much as I feel comfortable saying about it given how I've not spent a lot of time pouring over the lyrics, so I'll have to return to this later.
