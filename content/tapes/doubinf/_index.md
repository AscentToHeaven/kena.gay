# Double Infinity
## Big Thief

I actually knew nothing about this band or record before I got it on tape. Usually I only get things that I love dearly but not in this case.
The reason being that I had just gotten my player and the other tapes where a long way from here; instead of waiting, I got something from a local place.

I chose this one because I had heard very good things and seen all the positive reviews, Honestly I assumed it would be hip-hop given the bands name.

> So let gravity be my sculptor, let the wind do my hair  
Let me dance in front of people without a care  
Let me be naked alone with nobody there  
With mismatched socks and shoes and stuff stuffed in my underwear  

This is absolutely not something I would listen to normally. I'm not into folk and I'm not a fan of this kind of vibe.
So it arrives in my mailbox and I pop it into the player. At first I think it's a long and interesting intro, I was wrong.
After a bit I realize that it's a folk record, honestly I was disappointed.

Alas, it was the only tape I had and since I had it physically I should at least make it worth the price I paid, even if it's cheap. So I kept listening, over and over.
At this point I'm very fond of it and it's going to be nice to have in my collection, a lot of the lines hit my heart.

> All night, all day  
I could go down on you  
Hear you sing your pleasure  
God is good  
Or whatever made the mouth  
To drink the treasure  

(so gay)
