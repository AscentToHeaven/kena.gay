            <p>Bullshit, love, bullshit, love is bullshit</p>
<p>I am not allowed to have feelings<br />
Feelings would complicate this<br />
I'm a stupid ugly stuttering asshole<br />
There is no dignity in my anger<br />
Mind if I cough in your ear all night?<br />
Mind if I resent you for a year tonight?<br />
I am not the type of man<br />
Who can fall asleep in someone else's arms</p>
<p>(Didn't mean to lie 'bout it all) I love you, sometimes<br />
I love you but it's hard to say<br />
There are times when I don't love<br />
I can't love anything in this world</p>
<p>I want you to know, I want you to know<br />
I want you to know that I'm<br />
But I hope that you're<br />
I hope that you're a-</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what I say<br />
If you don't say anything in response<br />
The final phrase of my last sentence<br />
Hangs in the air, sounding stupider and stupider<br />
Why can't you at least laugh?<br />
I tried so hard to find the right words<br />
But it's a matter of timing, you only have so long<br />
To capture the feeling before it's gone</p>
<p>Here is a demo of my latest sentence<br />
I'll fill in the good parts later<br />
I'll make it fit together real nice<br />
And cut out all the "likes"</p>
<p>Two days ago it was really bad<br />
I couldn't get my head straight all day<br />
And everything you said seemed to have an edge<br />
You were disappointed and I didn't know why<br />
Eventually it came to a head<br />
Over something as stupid as making coffee<br />
You said it was a mistake to ever try and help me<br />
Then, you went in the kitchen</p>
<p>I drove off to go buy some stuff<br />
Which was a mistake because<br />
I didn't want to come back<br />
I just sat in the parking lot<br />
And dabbed at my thumb, which was bleeding for some reason<br />
Leaving a trail of red blossoms on the napkin<br />
I felt sick and I didn't know what to do<br />
How long would it be before I could face you?</p>
<p>Flashback to the first angry song I had to hide from you<br />
It goes like this:<br />
I am hiding from you at the<br />
QFC, QFC, QFC</p>
<p>Michael and Brian broke up today<br />
But we're not like them, no, we're nothing like them<br />
Frankie and Ava broke up today<br />
But we're not like them, no, we're nothing like them<br />
Felice and Lanky broke up today<br />
But we're not like them, no, nothing like them<br />
John and Yoko separated for a year<br />
But we're not like them, no, nothing like them<br />
The Beatles broke up today<br />
But we're not like them, no, we're nothing like them<br />
Paul said, "I just started doubting everything I did"<br />
But you're not like him, no, you're nothing like him</p>
<p>(I hope that you are! I hope that you are!)</p>
<p>Your parents and my parents, well, let's not get into that<br />
'Cause we're not like them, we are nothing like them<br />
Degnan and Skippy haven't spoken for a while<br />
But we're not like them, no, we're nothing like them, no no</p>
<p>(I hope that you are! I hope that you are!)</p>
<p>I hope that you're still asleep</p>
